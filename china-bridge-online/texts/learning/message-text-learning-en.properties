textui.learning.textBids.SB1-1-1=You will learn about the auction in the next chapter.
textui.learning.textCards.SB1-1-1=The opponent leads the Queen of {H}.\nAt trick one, you should above all not play dummy's Ace of {H} because the only card of your hand in South in that suit being the King, your two high cards would be played on the same trick.\nAs the King and the Ace are the highest cards in the suit, you have to play them separately to take 2 tricks in it.\nOnce the lead is taken with the K{H}, you should start playing your {D} to drive out the Ace.\nKnowing that you have 5 cards in {D} in South, you can take 4 tricks in the suit.\n\nOnce the opponent takes a trick with his Ace of {D}, you can get back to hand with your Ace of {H} (or the Ace of {S}) and you can then take your sure tricks:\n3 in Spades (Ace-King-Queen), 2 in Hearts (King and Ace) and 4 in Diamonds (Take care not to block yourself in North to be able to benefit from the 5th Diamond in South's hand).\n\nFeel free to play the deal again as many times as needed if you didn't manage to take 9 tricks.
textui.learning.textBids.SB1-1-3=You will learn about the auction in the next chapter.
textui.learning.textCards.SB1-1-3=The opponent leads the King of {H}.\n\nHere you have 5 sure tricks: 1 in Spades, 1 in Hearts, 2 in Diamonds and 1 in Clubs.\nThe challenge will be to find at least 2 other tricks before the opponents take 7.\n\nIf you start by taking your sure tricks, the opponents will, in turn, have sure tricks in the suits and you will only take 5 tricks.\n\nIt is absolutely necessary that you begin by playing a suit which can bring you extra tricks.\n\nThis suit is Clubs because you have 9 cards between you. If the 4 remaining cards split favourably between the opponents, you will be able to easily win 3 extra tricks.\n\nAfter taking the lead with the Ace of Hearts, play immediately the Ace of Clubs and another round of Clubs.\nWhen everyone follows suit on those two rounds, your Clubs are "established", i.e. they become master cards as the opponents have no cards left in that suit.\n\nThey can then cash all their tricks in Hearts. But if you take care to keep your Clubs and master cards when discarding, when they will play another suit (Diamonds or Spades), you will be able to take the remaining tricks:\n3 Clubs, 1 Spade and 2 Diamonds on top of the 2 tricks already taken (Ace of Hearts and Ace of Clubs) for 8 tricks in total.\n\nFeel free to play the deal again as many times as needed if you didn't manage to take these 8 tricks.
textui.learning.textBids.SB1-9-1=After the {1D} opening by East, South's bid is tricky.\nThe {1H} or {1S} overcall would promise 5 cards. An alternative could be to bid 1NT (the strength and distribution match) but a stopper in the opponents' suit is necessary.\nThe only possible call is a double showing at least 3 cards in the unnamed suits.\nWith 5 cards in Spades and 9 points, North responds {3S}, a bid which usually shows 8-10 points with 5 cards.\nSouth is more than happy to accept the invite to game with 16 HCP and 4 trumps.
textui.learning.textCards.SB1-9-1=West leads top of sequence, i.e. J{C}.\n\nFocus on your plan of play!\nIf you start trying to draw trumps, you are likely to go off in a contract that can be made.\nIndeed, if you let opponents lead with the A{S}, they will be able to take 4 tricks: 2{C}, 1{S} and 1{H}.\n\nOn lead with the A{C}, you should immediately discard a losing {C} on dummy's {D}.\nYou take the second trick with the A{D} and you continue with two other rounds of {D}, discarding a losing {C}.\nIt will then be time to play a trump to drive out the Ace.\nTake 10 tricks and you will make your contract and get a well-deserved score of +620 points.
textui.learning.textBids.SB1-10-1=With a balanced hand of 24 HCP, you should open {2C} to show the strength of your hand.\nNorth responds {2D}. This is necessary for you to be able to describe your hand.\nYou then bid {2N} to show a balanced hand.\nDespite his weak hand, North doesn't have the right to pass until game is reached. With 4 cards in {S}, he should bid Stayman with {3C}.\nWith 4 cards in {S}, the response is {3S}.\nNorth concludes the auction with {4S}, i.e. game.
textui.learning.textCards.SB1-10-1=West leads the Ace of {C}. The defending side takes the first 3 tricks in {C}.\n\nWhat is your plan of play?\n\nSouth should finesse to take the King of {S}. To do so, he should play from North's hand.\nHow? By getting over to dummy with the Jack of {D}.\nBut when in dummy, if you carelessly play a small {S}, once the finesse is successful, you will end up in South and you won't be able to get over to dummy because of a lack of communications.\nThe solution: In dummy with the Jack of {D}, play the 10{S} to be able to repeat the finesse against the K{S} over East.\nEither East covers the 10{S} and his King will be picked up or if he doesn't cover, you will be able to play a Spade from dummy to pick it up.\n\nA very nice coup but not easy at the first attempt!\n{4S} =, i.e. +620 to North/South.
textui.learning.textBids.SB1-11-1=East opens {1C} with 14 HCP. He doesn't have enough points to open {1N}.\nWith 6 cards in Hearts and 10 HCP, you meet the requirements for a preemptive overcall: {2H}.\nWest can bid {2S} with his 5 cards and 12 HCP. East concludes the auction with {4S}, with a fit and 15 points (distribution + HCP).
textui.learning.textCards.SB1-11-1=4{H} lead. \nWhat is your defensive plan to defeat this {4S} contract?\n\nYou take the first trick with the 10{H}. Then you play the K{H}.\nWhat should you play now? Dummy's Clubs are master cards. In Diamonds, in the best case, you will take a trick with the Ace of {D} but there is no hurry to cash it.\nThe best return is to play a {H}. The declarer will be able to ruff but your partner will be able to overruff too.\nNorth will benefit from a trump promotion on the deal!\n\nIf West ruffs with the 9{S}, North overruffs with the 10 and will take a trick with his Ace.\nIf West ruffs with the J{S}, North discards, being now certain of taking 2 trump tricks with A-10-4-third, whereas the declarer only has the King and Queen left.   \n\nYour preemptive overcall didn't disturb the opponents in naming their contract. However, at least it had the advantage of showing the right lead to your partner.\n\nResult: {4S} -1. +100 points to N/S instead of -620 points!
textui.learning.textBids.SB1-8-1=After East's opening, the {1N} overcall has the same meaning as without the opening, except that it ensures a stopper in the opponents' suit.\nWith the King of Hearts-third, South, who has the 15 points required and a balanced hand, can overcall {1N} without any problem.\nWith 10 points and no hope of fit in a major, North concludes the auction with {3N}.
textui.learning.textCards.SB1-8-1=Quite logically, West leads the 2 of {H} in his partner's suit.\n\nYou should prepare your plan of play: \nYou have 7 winners: 3 in {S}, 2 in {C} and 2 in {H}.\nYou have two suits which might produce the missing tricks: {C} and {D}.\n\n{D} could bring you 3 extra tricks but you have to put the opponents back on lead twice.\n{C} could bring you 2 extra tricks but the split has to be favourable in the opponents' hands (5 missing cards split 3/2).\n\nThe problem is that based on the auction, you know that East has 5 cards in {H}. If you put him back on lead twice, he will have time to take 3 tricks in {H} and two others in {D} before you can take your 9 tricks.\n\nYou should play {C} while not cutting your communications.\n\nHere is the right line of play: \nTake the lead in Hearts for instance from your hand with the King of {H}.\nYou unblock the Ace and Queen of {S}, then you play 2 rounds of {C} with the Ace and King.\nThen all you have to do is return {C} once to establish your suit.\nWhatever the opponents' return is, you will take 9 tricks (3 in {S}, 4 in {C} and 2 in {H}).\n\nAnother approach could have been to play a small {C} from both hands at the second trick immediately. This is the ducking technique. You will learn more about it later.\n\nYou will earn +600 points with your 9 tricks and contract made.

textui.learning.textCards.empty=No particular comment about card play.
textui.learning.textBids.SB1-7-1=North opens {1N} to show a balanced hand of 15-17 HCP. \nWith 10 points, South can look for game. Since he has 4 cards in {H} and {S}, he should use the Stayman convention ({2C}) to find out if North has a 4-card major. The {2H} response shows 4 cards in {H}. With 10 points, South can end the auction with {4H}, i.e. game.
textui.learning.textCards.SB1-7-1=East leads the Ace of {S}.\n\nYou should prepare your plan of play: \nYou have 4 losers: 1 in trumps, 1 in {C} and 2 in {S}.\nIn order to lose only 2 tricks in Spades, you have to ruff two without being overruffed.\nTo avoid losing the trick in {C}, you could finesse, hoping that the King is in West but you can also discard a {C} on your fourth {D}.\n\nHere is the right line of play: \nWhatever East's return is after having cashed two rounds of Spades, don't fall into the trap of the finesse in {C}.\nStart by drawing two rounds of trumps (the Ace, then the King) and finish in dummy. \nYou will be able to ruff a {S} and then to get over to dummy in {D} to ruff your last {S}. \nThen all you will have to do is cash your master cards in {D} to discard dummy's losing {C}. Whether the last trump is in East or West, the opponents will only take one trick with it.\nIf West ruffs a {D} and plays in {C}, be careful, play your Ace of {C} and cash your last master cards in {D} if you don't want to see East take a trick with the King of {C}.\n\nYou will only lose 3 tricks, 2 in {S} and 1 in {H}, for a = result and 620 points.
textui.learning.textBids.SB1-4-1=Facing a {1N} opening promising 15 HCP, the responder is strong enough to force to game. He bids {3N} which becomes the final contract. \nSouth is the declarer because he is the first from the North-South side who bid {N}.
textui.learning.textCards.SB1-4-1=South has 7 top tricks (4 in {D}, 2 in {C} and 1 in {S}). \nHe will be able to find the missing tricks in {H} where he can establish 3 extra tricks. \nOn this deal, the risk is that the opponents take 5 tricks before you can take 9. \nIf the {S} split 4/4, no problem, you will only lose 4 tricks (3 in {S} and 1 in {H}). It is dangerous if the {S} split 5/3, probably with 5 cards in West since he led his longest suit. \nIf West has the Ace of {H}, you won't be able to do anything. But if East has it, the ducking technique will enable you to make your contract. \nFirst, you have to duck the first two rounds of {S} (play the 5{S} and the 8{S}). When you take the third round of Spades, East doesn't have any left. \nSo when you will play in {H} to drive his Ace out, he will no longer be able to put his partner back on lead to take tricks with their two master cards in Spades. \n\nYou will take 10 well-deserved tricks.
textui.learning.textBids.SB1-5-1=With 5 cards and 13 points, the 1{H} opening is appropriate.\nSouth has nothing special to bid over 2{C} but he can't pass because North's bid is forcing. So he bids 2{H} which doesn't promise 6 cards.\nThe 4{H} bid shows that a slam is too far to be explored.
textui.learning.textCards.SB1-5-1=The declarer ducks the lead and continues in {S}. \nTo take 10 tricks with usual splits, the safest option is to ruff a {S} in dummy and to establish long cards in {C}, which will work in case of 3/3 or 4/2 splits (84%). \nThe declarer draws 2 rounds of trumps and continues with the A{C}, the K{C} and a ruffed {C}. Then a ruffed {S} and a ruffed {C}. \nSouth gets over to dummy with the Ace of {D} and cashes the last {C}. \nIf West ruffs at any time, it doesn't change anything... Except if he makes the mistake of underplaying the King of {D}, allowing the declarer to take an overtrick.
textui.learning.textBids.SB1-6-1=South can't open {1N} with 14 points (15-17 are needed). With no 5-card major, he chooses his better minor: {1C}. \nNorth responds {1H} showing 4 cards in the suit. \n\nAfter a fit is found, South bids {2H} to show a rather minimum hand with 4 cards in {H}. \nWith 14 points, North can stop at game without any problem and that is what he does by bidding {4H}. \n\nOpener's rebids with a fit (with 4 cards in {H}):\n{2H} (minimum point range): with 12-14 HCP. \n{3H} (invite to game): with 15-17 HCP (and a singleton for not having opened {1N}). \n{4H} (strong hand): with 18-22 HCP.
textui.learning.textCards.SB1-6-1=South counts 8 tricks: 3 in {S}, 1 in {D} and 4 in {C}, on top of the trump suit where he is certain of taking 2 tricks. \nTherefore he starts by drawing trumps but East takes with the King of {H} and returns {D}. \nSouth tries the finesse but the Queen is covered by the King. The {D} return is then taken by the Ace. \nTherefore South should make sure that he only concedes one {D} because otherwise, he would go down, losing 2{D} and the Ace/King of {H}. \nBefore returning trumps, he hurries to cash dummy's {S} and discards a {D} from his hand.
textui.learning.textBids.SB1-1-2=You will learn about the auction in the next chapter.
textui.learning.textCards.SB1-1-2=Your partner leads the J{D} and you have to decide between following with a small {D} or your Ace of {D}. Leading the J{D} is a top of a sequence lead, i.e. North led the highest card of his sequence. He may have J109 but not the Queen. \nIt allows you to locate the Queen in West. If you follow with the Ace of {D}, West will not play his Queen and will therefore be able to take two tricks in Diamonds: the Queen and the King. However, playing low, West will take this first trick with his Queen but he won't take any others. When North will play his 10{D}, if he plays low in dummy, you will also play a low {D}. If he plays his King, you will take it with your Ace. \n\nDon't forget that rule: the defending side's honours are intended to pick up lower honours held by the declarer's side. On this example deal, your A{D} should pick up dummy's K{D}. \n\nIf you play the Ace of {D} at the first trick, the declarer will easily take 9 tricks. But if you play a low {D}, West will be in difficulty: he can take 8 tricks (4{S}, 3{H}, 1{D}). To make his {3N} contract, he has to take 9. He will therefore look for his missing trick in Clubs, trying to finesse against the Queen of {C} (forcing).\n\nHe starts by drawing 4 rounds of Spades. It won't do any harm. Then he cashes 2 rounds of Hearts, finishing in dummy. He plays the J{C} but since the Queen is not well-located (in North, not in South), he will see all the Diamonds as well as the Ace and Queen of Clubs being run, and he will go one off. \n\nVery good defence if you managed to defeat the contract. Otherwise, feel free to play the deal again.
textui.learning.textBids.SB1-2-1=West opens {1H} showing at least 12 points and at least 5 cards in {H}.\nThe {2H} simple raise by East promises a 3-card fit and up to 6-10 points. \nEven if East brings the minimum possible, i.e. 6 points, West's points are sufficient to force to game.\nTherefore West jumps to game, bidding {4H}.
textui.learning.textCards.SB1-2-1=The lead of the Jack of {S} is telling South that the Queen, and probably the King, are in West. \nIndeed, leading from a tenace often has negative consequences, especially when the RHO described a strong hand. \nYou are likely to give away an honour with which the opener would not take a trick otherwise. \nThis is telling South that there is no future in {S}. \n\nObserving the dummy should help him find the right return. \nIndeed, East's three small {D} definitely represent the best chance of taking tricks for the defending side. \nThey will take tricks with the two black Aces and 2 tricks in {D} for one down. \n\nIf South insists in {S}, West takes a trick, plays the Ace and Queen of {H}, keeping the King in dummy as a potential entry, and continues with the King of {C}. \nWhether South takes the Ace on the first or second round doesn't change anything. The King of {H} serves as an entry to have access to the two master {C} allowing to discard two {D} held by West, who  finally only concedes two black Aces and one Diamond. \n\nFor your information, if East-West make their {4H} contract, South will lose 620 points. But if North-South manage to defeat them, they will earn 100 points.
textui.learning.textBids.SB1-3-1=With a balanced hand of 15-17 points, South opens {1N}.\nIt is considered legitimate that you bid a small slam starting from 33 points. \nThe {1N} opening promising at least 15 points, responder's 18 points allow him to bid 6NT because the strength of the side is at least 33 points. \nNorth has 4 cards in {H}. He should first check if his partner has also 4 cards in that suit.\n\nTherefore he uses the Stayman {2C} convention. \nSouth responds {2S} to show 4 cards in {S} without 4 cards in {H}. \nAll North has to do is conclude the auction with 6NT.\n\nIf it is successful, this small slam will make them earn 990 points.
textui.learning.textCards.SB1-3-1=West leads the Jack of {C} and South counts 12 top tricks. \nThe challenge will be to play them in the right order. \nThe declarer takes the lead from his hand and starts by unblocking the King and Jack of {S}. \nThen he plays his master {H}, discarding a {D} from his hand. \nHe crosses to his hand via the Ace of {C} to cash the Ace and Queen of {S} before finishing with {C}. \nIf West kept his {C} until the end, South will be limited to 12 tricks and will earn 990 points split as follows: \n500 points as slam bonus, 300 points as game bonus, as well as 30 points per trick from the eighth one, the seventh one being worth 40 points.
